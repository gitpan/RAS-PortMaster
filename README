DESCRIPTION

RAS::PortMaster is a PERL 5 module for interfacing with a Livingston 
PortMaster remote access server. Using this module, one can very easily 
construct programs to find a particular user in a bank of PMs, disconnect 
users, get usage statistics, or execute arbitrary commands on a PM.


PREREQUISITES AND INSTALLATION

This module uses Jay Rogers' Net::Telnet module. If you don't have 
Net::Telnet, get it from CPAN or this module won't do much for you.

Installation is easy:
   perl Makefile.PL && make && make test
   make install

For more information, see the POD documentation in the module itself.
