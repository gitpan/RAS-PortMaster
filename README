DESCRIPTION

RAS::PortMaster is a PERL 5 module for interfacing with a Livingston 
PortMaster remote access server. Using this module, one can very easily 
construct programs to find a particular user in a bank of PMs, disconnect 
users, get usage statistics, or execute arbitrary commands on a PM.


PREREQUISITES AND INSTALLATION

This module uses Jay Rogers' Net::Telnet module. If you don't have 
Net::Telnet, get it from CPAN or this module won't do much for you.

Installation is easy:
   perl Makefile.PL && make
   make test
   make install

Read the output of "make test" to make sure it's sensical.
No point running the test if you don't read the output...

Check out the tests in test.pl and the examples in the 
documentation for examples on how you'd want to use this module.


DOCUMENTATION

For more information, see the POD documentation in the module itself.
Try "pod2text PortMaster.pm | more" or see the installed manpage.
